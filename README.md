Code Refactor Assignment

 The goal of this assignment was to refactor code for an existing webpage. Refactoring code is the process of simplifying and cleaning up existing code without hindering the behavior of the webpage. Along with simplifying and cleaning up bugs in the code I aimed to make it more accessible  for people with disabilities to access the website.
 
 In the html I substituted semantic html tags in order to more accrurately convey the structure and function of the webpage and its components. This corrected the repatativeness of the div tags and allowed the tags present to serve a purpose as opposed to being a placeholder.

 The first link on the navigation bar was not linking to the designated SEO part of the webpage. This was updated using an id attribute. Now when clicked, the Search Engine Optimization button in the navigation bar links the user to the Search Engine Optimization section of the webpage.
 
 For example: clicking <img width="266" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-06 at 3 03 25 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71091515/98415653-4b1cac00-2043-11eb-96e2-5d96f7129ef1.png">
 
 Will now lead user to this designated spot on the webpage: <img width="926" alt="Screen Shot 2020-11-06 at 3 04 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71091515/98415780-861edf80-2043-11eb-8eaf-2a13d7b0ccec.png">
 
 Other changes to the html included adding descriptive alt attributes to images to allow better accessibility to users utilizing a screen reader. I checked to make sure that the "keyboard focus" is responsive and in working order for navigating the website using the tab key. 

 In the linked css style sheet I consolidated many css attributes to simplify the file and remove repetitive code. 

 This assignment improved the existing website by making it fully functional, accessible and sustainable. The updated clear and concise code will be shorter and easier to interpret and therefore is less likely to contain bugs. I learned that making a website that is fully accessible to an array of users is a top priority and should be given the utmost thought when designing a webpage. Thinking of all types of access will allow more users to benefit from your content!
